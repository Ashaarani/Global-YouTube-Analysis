# Analysis of Global YouTube Statistics 2023

## Abstract

YouTube has become one of the most powerful content creation platforms where creators share different content, affecting people globally. Marketers, platform analysts, and content creators need to understand what determines the performance or failure of YouTube channels. This study considers multiple aspects of YouTube data analysis aimed at establishing correlations between vital metrics such as revenue, number of views of the videos, and subscribers, and their impact on key changes about YouTube’s cultural and business relevance. 

## Keywords

- Social Media
- Data Analysis
- Machine Learning Models
- Python

## Research Questions

1. What factors are associated with the success and performance of YouTube channels, considering metrics such as subscriber counts, video views, and earnings?
2. How do these factors vary across different content categories and countries of origin?

## Why the Problem is Important

Understanding YouTube trends helps marketers make informed decisions about their target audience and content creators understand what content is being consumed. This analysis also aids in content discoverability, helping creators gain more subscribers and views, ultimately expediting monetization.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is collected from Kaggle and provides a comprehensive insight into the state of YouTube on a global scale in 2023. It includes various metrics and variables capturing different aspects of YouTube's dynamics, such as user engagement, content trends, geographical distribution, and platform performance.

### Attributes Description

- **Rank**: Position of the YouTube channel based on the number of subscribers
- **Youtuber**: Name of the YouTube channel
- **Subscribers**: Number of subscribers to the channel
- **Video views**: Total views across all videos on the channel
- **Category**: Category or niche of the channel
- **Title**: Title of the YouTube channel
- **Uploads**: Total number of videos uploaded on the channel
- **Country**: Country of origin of the YouTube channel
- **Other attributes**: Include various metrics such as earnings, new subscribers, creation date, etc.

## Proposed Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Importing, cleaning, and addressing issues like missing values and outliers.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using summary statistics and visualization tools to understand the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to enhance the analysis.
4. **Statistical Testing**: Conducting hypothesis tests to determine significant differences and correlations.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Applying machine learning algorithms to predict future metrics.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and correcting data, handling missing values, and normalizing features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Using graphical tools like scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to understand trends and patterns.
3. **Feature Selection**: Using methods like PCA and RFE to select important features.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Training models like Naïve Bayes, KNN, Random Forest, SVM, MLP Classifier, and Logistic Regression.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Using metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy to evaluate model performance.

## Result Analysis

Performance of classification models varies significantly depending on the feature selection method applied. Random Forest consistently shows superior performance, with its robustness further enhanced by the application of SMOTE.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide content creators, businesses, and marketers with data-backed recommendations for creating engaging content, optimizing channels, and connecting with their target audience more effectively on YouTube.
